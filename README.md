# net-adapter
Way back in 2012, I wanted a simple way to get the IP and Mac address of the current computer. 

Since Google Code is shutting down, I moved it. Here is the original blog post:

```
# Net Adapter – AKA the “Get IP/MAC address” library
So hey. I wrote and open sourced a small cross platform library for getting 
the IP and MAC address of the current device. You can find it on Google Code.

So far I’ve tested it on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OSX Mountain Lion.
It *should* also work on iOS, BSD and Android. If you happen to test it on 
one of those other platforms, I would love to know what the Sample program 
outputs. Thanks!

I've since merged-in one user patch that should fix a potential crashes on Android.
